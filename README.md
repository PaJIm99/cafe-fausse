#### AI Tooling Used
I used ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5) as an AI code generation assistant throughout development.
Examples of usage:

1) Generated initial Flask endpoints (/api/reservations, /api/newsletter).

2) Helped design SQLAlchemy models and DB schema.

3) Wrote React components (ReservationForm, NewsletterForm, Hero, etc.).

4) Assisted in debugging async vs sync issues (pick_table coroutine bug).

5) Suggested UI/UX improvements like inline validation, success/error messages, and consistent navigation.

6) All generated code was reviewed, tested, and adjusted by me.

7) The AI acted as a pair programmer to speed up development and improve quality.
